# ðŸŒ² Alpine.js Practice

Welcome to my Alpine.js learning playground! This repo contains my experiments, code snippets, and small projects built while learning Alpine.js â€” the lightweight JavaScript framework that brings reactivity to the DOM with minimal fuss.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside?

- âœ… Interactive UI components
- âœ… State & binding examples

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack

- **Alpine.js**
- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** (in some examples)
- Vanilla JS (sprinkled where needed)

## ðŸ’¡ Why Alpine.js?

Alpine lets you write reactive frontend behavior with zero build tools.  
Itâ€™s like Vueâ€™s baby cousin â€” perfect for simple interactivity on otherwise static pages.
